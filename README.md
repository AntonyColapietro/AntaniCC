## AntaniCC Mod for minecraft

A mod that links ComputerCraft to Industrialcraft2. It's a mod that I created to increase synergy in a personal 
IC2 based modpack. I plan to add other mod interactions in the future, but I may never have the time...

## Supported tile entities
   * TileEntityElectricBlock [IndustrialCraft2]

The original idea is from forhaxed / https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/industrial-peripheral

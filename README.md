A mod that links ComputerCraft to Industrialcraft2. It's a mod that I created to increase synergy in a personal 
IC2 based modpack. I plan to add other mod interactions in the future, but I may never have the time...

## Supported tile entities
   * TileEntityElectricBlock [IC2]
   * TileEntityLiquidTankElectricMachine [IC2]
   * TileEntityFluidRegulator [IC2]
